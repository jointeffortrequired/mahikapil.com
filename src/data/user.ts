  about: `
Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, better that best.” 

I am a passionate & driven Mass Comm. Student. 
Along with that, I am a budding psychologist. Whether it’s about taking initiative in group projects, mentoring peers, or stepping up in difficult situations, I’m dedicated to leading with integrity and making a positive impact, I am a go-getter. I thrive in dynamic environments. With a strong work ethic and the hunger to grow both personally and professionally
